## Setup

To get started, we will need to:

1. Create a symlink from the project directory,
   `/global/cfs/cdirs/m4388/Project2-ClimRR/` into your `$HOME` directory

   ```bash
   ln -s /global/cfs/cdirs/m4388/Project2-ClimRR/ $HOME/Project2-ClimRR
   ```

2. Navigate into here and create your personal directory (where you will store
   and work on **your** project):

   ```bash
   cd $HOME/Project2-ClimRR/
   mkdir $USER
   cd $USER
   ```

3. Clone the [{{< fa brands github >}} GitHub repo](https://github.com/saforem2/climate-analysis)

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/saforem2/climate-analysis
  ```
