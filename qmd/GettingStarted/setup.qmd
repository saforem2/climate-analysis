# Getting Started

To install / setup your environment to run the code for this project we need to

1. Download the data
2. Install the `CLimRR` python package

which we describe below.

## Download the Data

The data is available as a `*.zip` file with everything you will need to get started.

::: {.callout-important title="Download Data" collapse="true" style="width:100%; place-self: end;"}

- [ClimRR Data Download (ANL)](https://anl.box.com/s/hmkkgkrkzxxocfe9kpgrzk2gfc4gizp8)

:::

1. Clone the {{< fa brands github >}} [Github
   repo](https://github.com/saforem2/climate-analysis)
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saforem2/climate-analysis
   cd ./climate-analysis/
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (`venv`)[^1] and install `ClimRR` into it[^2]:
   ```bash
   # ------------------------------------------------------------
   # 1. Make a directory where the venv will live
   mkdir -p ./venvs/ClimRR
   # 2. Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv`
   python3 -m venv ./venvs/ClimRR --system-site-packages
   # 3. Install the python package as an editable install (`-e`)
   # ------------------------------------------------------------
   python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
   # 4. Verify the package was installed correctly
   python3 -c 'import ClimRR ; print(ClimRR.__file__)'
   # should print something like:
   # /Users/samforeman/projects/saforem2/climate-analysis/src/ClimRR/__init__.py
   ```

[^1]: The `--system-site-packages` flag tells python to include the libraries
from our system-wide install in this `venv`

[^2]: 
      Installation options:

      - the `-e` flag tells python to perform an _editable_ install (i.e. install
      package from its path, `.`, in this case)
      - the `.[dev]` option says to install the package located here (`.`),
      including the development extensions specified in the
      [`pyproject.toml`](https://github.com/saforem2/climate-analysis/blob/main/pyproject.toml)
