# Project Overview: `ClimRR`

This  project explores the intersection of climate data and energy justice,
providing an introductory understanding of data science techniques in assessing
disparate outcomes on vulnerable or underserved populations in the United
States. By shedding light on energy disparities, the project aims to contribute
to the ongoing discussions surrounding energy equity and inform policymakers
and stakeholders for more inclusive energy initiatives. Energy justice refers
to the equitable distribution of clean, affordable, and reliable energy
resources among all communities, regardless of their socioeconomic status or
demographic characteristics.

The project focuses on analyzing climate data to assess disparate outcomes in
energy access and consumption across different population groups. By leveraging
introductory data science skills, the study aims to uncover patterns, trends,
and potential disparities in energy justice.

The project will involve several key steps. Firstly, relevant climate data,
such as temperature, precipitation, and renewable energy sources, will be
collected from reliable sources. This data will be preprocessed and cleaned to
ensure its quality and usability for analysis.

Next, the data will be analyzed using introductory data science techniques.
This may include exploratory data analysis, descriptive statistics, and data
visualization to identify patterns and trends within the dataset. The analysis
will focus on examining energy consumption patterns, renewable energy adoption
rates, and energy affordability across different geographical regions and
demographic groups.

To assess disparate outcomes, the project will employ various statistical
techniques to compare energy-related indicators among vulnerable populations.
This may involve analyzing energy access in low-income neighborhoods,
evaluating the impact of energy policies on marginalized communities, or
examining the correlation between energy affordability and socioeconomic
factors.

The findings of the analysis will be interpreted to gain insights into the
disparities in energy justice and its impact on vulnerable populations. The
project aims to identify areas where energy inequalities exist and provide a
data-driven foundation for advocating for equitable energy policies and
programs.
