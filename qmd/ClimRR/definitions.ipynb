    "(e.g. 2046, 2047, and so forth) and across all three climate models (CCSM,\n",

    "average of each day's 8 wind speed readings) for every day within a given time\n",

    "(e.g. 2045) and within a given time period / scenario (e.g. mid-century RCP4.5)\n",
    "and for a given climate model (e.g. CCSM), which produced the annual average\n",

    "## Consecutive Days With No Precipitation\n",
    "\n",

    "mid-century RCP4.5) and for a given climate model (e.g. CCSM).\n",
    "\n",
