[ClimRR](https://disgeoportal.egs.anl.gov/ClimRR/): Empowering individuals,
governments, and organizations to examine simulated future climate conditions
at mid- and end-of-century for a range of climate perils[^img]
:::


## Climate Risk \& Resilience Portal (`ClimRR`)

The [ClimRR Portal](https://www.anl.gov/ccrds/ClimRR) can be viewed online, and
is a great resource for interactive exploration.


Climate change is increasing the complexity, intensity, and frequency of
disasters.

Understanding future climate conditions in cities and towns across the United
States is necessary to prepare for future climate realities.  

To address this requirement, ClimRR[^climrr] — the Climate Risk and Resilience
Portal — empowers individuals, governments, and organizations to examine
simulated future climate conditions at mid- and end-of-century for a range of
climate perils.

> **Project Description**  
> :::
> Are different populations unequally affected  by climate change? This project
> will explore the intersection of climate data and energy justice, providing an
> introductory understanding of data science techniques in assessing disparate
> outcomes on vulnerable or underserved populations in the United States.
> By shedding light on energy disparities, the project aims to contribute to the
> ongoing discussions surrounding energy equity and inform policymakers and
> stakeholders for more inclusive energy initiatives. Energy justice refers to
> the equitable distribution of clean, affordable, and reliable energy resources
> among all communities, regardless of their socioeconomic status or demographic
> characteristics.
> 
> This project will focus on the analysis of climate data and low-income energy
> affordability data across the United States. The analysis will focus on
> examining energy consumption patterns, renewable energy adoption rates, and
> energy affordability across different geographical regions and demographic
> groups.
> 
> To assess disparate outcomes, the project will employ various statistical
> techniques to compare energy-related indicators among vulnerable populations.
> 
> This work may involve analyzing energy access in low-income neighborhoods,
> evaluating the impact of energy policies on marginalized communities, or
> examining the correlation between energy affordability and socioeconomic
> factors.
> 
> The findings of the analysis will be interpreted to gain insights into the
> disparities in energy justice and its impact on vulnerable populations. The
> project aims to identify areas where energy inequalities exist and provide a
> data-driven foundation for advocating for equitable energy policies and
> programs.
